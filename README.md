# gsandf-diff-linting-rules

> A playground for testing linting rule changes

We wanted to see what rules would be added by extending additional ESLint
configs.

This isn't a useful CLI tool, but it could easily be one.

## Usage

Write new differences to `differences.json`:

```sh
yarn start
```

To modify rules to test against, see `index.js`.
